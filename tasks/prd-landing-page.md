    ```css
    /* Light Mode */
    :root {
      --background: oklch(1.0000 0 0);
      --foreground: oklch(0.3211 0 0);
      --card: oklch(1.0000 0 0);
      --primary: oklch(0.6231 0.1880 259.8145);
      --primary-foreground: oklch(1.0000 0 0);
      --secondary: oklch(0.9670 0.0029 264.5419);
      --secondary-foreground: oklch(0.4461 0.0263 256.8018);
      --border: oklch(0.9276 0.0058 264.5313);
      --ring: oklch(0.6231 0.1880 259.8145);
    }
    /* Dark Mode */
    .dark {
      --background: oklch(0.2046 0 0);
      --foreground: oklch(0.9219 0 0);
      --card: oklch(0.2686 0 0);
      --primary: oklch(0.6231 0.1880 259.8145);
      --primary-foreground: oklch(1.0000 0 0);
      --secondary: oklch(0.2686 0 0);
      --secondary-foreground: oklch(0.9219 0 0);
      --border: oklch(0.3715 0 0);
      --ring: oklch(0.6231 0.1880 259.8145);
    }

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js with TypeScript.

*   **Secondary Metrics:**
    *   Total number of unique visitors.
    *   Average time on page.
    *   Bounce rate.
